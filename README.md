# MERN Book Search Engine

## User Story
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

## Summary

Challenge was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
Troubleshooting still required to fix the code and deploying to heroku errors
